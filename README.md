# digColl_novelaMundial
La Novela Mundial is a series of popular fiction that was published by Rivadeneyra (S.A.) in Madrid, Spain between 1926 and 1928, during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. Among many collections of short literature and other publications, La Novela Mundial represents one of the larger collections of the period before the Spanish Civil War. Similar to "dime store" books, these were known as "novelas de kiosko," because they were sold in newsstands, most for between 30 and 50 cents. The series includes novellas and plays with beautiful color illustrations on the cover and black and white illustrations throughout. Authors include Leopoldo García-Alas y Ureña (Clarín) and members of la generación del 98 like Ramón María del Valle-Inclán and Manuel Bueno.
